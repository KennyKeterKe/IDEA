# IDEAMPLIFIER
A crowdfunding platform empower entrepreneurs by transforming their amazing idea into something tangible by making the most out of their networks

## Description
HELLO developers and all the  potential users of IDEAMPLIFIER, welcome to my pageü§ç. As the founder of IDEAMPLIFIER, I will elaborate all necessary information of my new appliation - IDEAMPLIFIER, especailly how developers could start the application and how users could use this application.

## Main Features of Application

- Pitch Video Upload: Users can upload their pitch videos and the platform can store the relevant information.
- Certification Process: The platform certifies uploaded pitch videos based on their potential for receiving investments in the future.
- User-friendly, engaging, yound and fun user experience.

# For developers
How to start the application

## Technologies Used
- Python: The backend logic of the application is written in Python, especially the main features:  Pitch Video Upload and Certification Process.
- Flask: Flask web framework is used for handling routing and server-side operations.
- HTML/CSS: The frontend interface is built using HTML and CSS for a user-friendly, engaging, and fun user experience.

## Why I used these technologies?

## HTML
1. HTML offers a structured and hierarchical approach to organizing content, making information on Ideamplifier clear and organized.
2. It ensures cross-platform compatibility, allowing users to access the platform from various devices and browsers.
3. HTML is relatively easy to learn and use, with a straightforward syntax using tags to define elements.
4. Seamless integration with CSS allows for styling and customization, enhancing the visual presentation of the platform.
5. By leveraging HTML and CSS together, we can create an engaging and user-friendly experience for Ideamplifier's visitors.

## Python
1. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, and I have some experience in using Python to conduct data analysis.
2. Python also provides robust web development frameworks like Flask. These frameworks come with built-in tools and structures that simplify common web development tasks, which are in alignment with the nature of our product.

## Prerequisites
To run the Ideamplifier MVP, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Package Installer for Python)
- Relevant packages: flask, flask_wtf, wtforms, werkzeug.utils, and os

## Usage

1. Copy the codes from app.py
2. Create three HTML documents, whcih are index.html, MVP.html, and uploaded.html. More specifically, MVP.html is the webpage users will see when they click the link; index.html is the web page where users will upload their pitch video; uploaded.html is the webpage where the professionals of the platform will decide whether to certify the uploaded video
3. It should be noted that this is the code for a MVP, such that what users can uploaded to the website and what the website can certify currently is picture only.
4. Run the application in the terminal: `python app.py`
5. Access the application in your web browser at: `http://localhost:5000`, this will lead you to the website where users can upload their videos.
6. When the picture is uploaded, you will be able to see the uploaded picture under "static/files"
7. After the picture is uploaded succeefully, the web page where the platform will decide whethe ror not to certify the picture will be shown and the professinals of the website will be able to make a choice on whether or not give a certification to the uploaded picture.

## Website development

1. It is highly suggested to follow all the beforementioned instructions and store all the codes as the github could directly transform your HTML document into a web page.
2. The main page of this website is the MVP.html. After uploading this code to the Github, go to "settings" then the feature of "page" on the left side. By doing so, git hub will create a website for you automatically and accordingly. As a result, anyone who clicked the link can have access to our platform right now.
